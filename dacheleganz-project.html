            <p class="mt-0">
                The German company Dacheleganz was found at the end of 2017 and comprises of a single individual. The company
                owner is a carpenter and designs different wood pieces that he wants to sell in his webshop. Furthermore, the company is
                able to design wood pieces on a request (different shapes or sizes). Additionally, the company assembles different things
                like kitchens, etc. and can be called for some work from other companies as well.
                The website including the webshop will target mostly German customers of different ages.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-header">Design Process</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="mt-0">
                    As the first part of the design process, I conducted a customer research. In this case I chose for a questionnaire.
                    With a questionnaire, it was possible to reach a lot of people at the same time.
                    The questionnaire consisted of customer specific information as the gender and age range. Additionally, it had questions
                    about the customer behaviour, for example, ’How often do you buy products online?’, ’How long does it take you to make a
                    buying decision?’ and ’Where do you go when you are looking for products?’. In that case, I had a better overview of the
                    customer behavior while buying products online. Moreover, specific questions about wood work could be found in the
                    questionnaire as well, for example, ’Did you ever purchase wood work online?’ or ’What is your typical budget for wood
                    work?’.
                    <br />
                    I conducted a German questionnaire as well as an English one. The English questionnaire had 32 responses and the
                    German one had 19 responses. I shared both questionnaires in Facebook groups for woodwork and among family, friends,
                    and classmates.
                    <br />
                    In general, the questionnaire conducted three interesting questions about where they look for products (figure 1), how far
                    they would travel to purchase a product (figure 2) and what their typical budget for woodwork is (figure 3).
                    All in all, the two most often visited websites to look for products are Google and Amazon. The third most place is the
                    local store where people can actually go to and even touch the product they want to buy (figure 1).

                <p class="mt-0">
                    After the questionnaire, I created three persona’s. The primary persona is Delia Hempton:
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-portfolio persona" src="img/portfolio/Dacheleganz/Persona_Delia_Hampton.jpg" alt="Persona Delia Hempton" title="">
                        <figcaption>Fig4. - Persona: Delia Hempton.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    Based on the questionnaire and the persona’s, I created requirements by myself. Afterwards I evaluated them with the
                    company owner. Together we had a look at the MoSCoW method to prioritize all requirements.
                    <br />
                    The form factor will be a website with a webshop where the customer should be able to use this website on a desktop
                    as well as on a tablet and phone. Moreover, the application will be used in a normal household situation during the day
                    and evening. This requires a transient posture which implies that these applications must be simple, clear and to the
                    point. In general, the decision was made to not have accounts on the website. It is not expected that the customers
                    come back every week to buy a new product. Furthermore, accounts create the issue that someone has to manage the
                    accounts and keep track of everything. Due to the size of the company, it is decided to only have guest accounts on
                    the website. To get some input for different ideas, I conducted the Generative Research method with a few students
                    from the Interaction Design program. I told them basic information about the company and the project and asked
                    them to concentrate on the menu and the navigation between the different pages of the website. Sketches are the
                    outcome of this method. Two of the most detailed and structured sketches are the following ones:

                <p class="mt-0">
                    After the input from the Generative Research, I specified the functions for the website that can be accessed from the
                    header and from the footer. After defining the different elements and the hierarchy, I created sketches. In general,
                    the most important webpages within the webshop are the homepage, product page and product detail page. These will be
                    the pages where the customers will mostly interact with.

                    Before testing these sketches with different people, I created use case scenarios. These scenarios help to test if the
                    potential customers are able to purchase an existing as well as a customized product.
                    <br />
                    I tried to test the sketches with different people. Most of them had difficulties to imagine a functional website.
                    They didn’t have a lof of comments. I decided to create wireframes to test them more extensively, because people
                    can better imagine a functional website behind them.
                    <br />
                    The wireframes were created in Adobe XD.

                    To check the earlier created scenarios with the wireframes I used the Think-aloud protocol in addition to the Wizard of
                    Oz method. In this iteration I tested the wireframes with an Interation Design student and Software Engineering student.
                    Their opinions were valuable, because they could easily detect problems non experienced people can struggle with.
                    <br />
                    The Wizard of Oz website was an Invision project. Invision is a website where it is possible to create interactive
                    prototypes from wireframes or other images. The testers got a link from me that they could enter in their browser
                    and the prototype was loading as a website. In that case they could use their own laptop and felt comfortable
                    within their customized browser.
                    <br />
                    Based on the outcome of the user test with the first wireframes, I created a second version of the wireframes.
                    I user tested the renewed wireframes with the company owner as well as a middle aged woman. All in all, they were
                    satisfied with the website and could find everything based on the key path scenario.
                    <br />
                    After the successful user test I started with the look and feel screens. Moreover, I decided which colors should
                    be used for the website to give the impression of a professional business. Green is a cold color that represents
                    nature and is usually calming and relaxing. Dacheleganz is working with wood which is a natural product. Green is
                    a good basis to work with, because it is calming, represents nature and gives a trustworthy image to the website
                    and the company. Brown accents deliver a perfect match to the green. Brown is associated with the earth, wood, and stone.
