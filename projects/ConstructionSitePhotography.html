          <h2>Construction Site Photography</h2>
          <hr class="small">
          <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>
              The Construction Site Photography interface was developed in a team consistent of 5 people.
              The two backgrounds that were given were 'Photographers' and 'Construction sites'.
              The goal was to create an interface for an app based on this background.
              <br />
              At first, we started to create different ideas with the help of the 'Design charette', 'Brainstorming', 'Now, How, Wow Matrix' and 'Dot Voting' methods.
              In the end we had like 9 ideas and chose the best one according to the design methods - 'Construction Site Photography'.
            </p>
            <cite>
              &quot;Our mission is to create a system mainly for photographers which provides an interactive map with construction sites, tagged photos from other users and photographic challenges. The system works as an educational, inspirational and explorational system for photographers.&quot;
            </cite>
            <p>
              After the idea generation process we conducted semi-structured interviews with two photographers to broaden our knowledge.
              In between the two interviews we created sketches and prototypes with the POP app.
              In POP it is possible to take an image of the sketches and add links to connect the different pages for the interaction with the user.

            <p>
              The sketches as well as the POP prototype were tested by a Focus group, user tests and one of the two professional photographers.
              <br />
              After these tests and some design changes, we created a digital version of our sketches.

              At the end of the project we figured out that the interfaces suited the best for hoppy photographers interested in construction sites.
              In case this app should fit for professional photographers as well, some major changes would have to be made.
              For example, due to the interviews with the professional photographers, we found out that they would require some job related content as well.
              At this point it is important to make a decision to focus either on hobby or professional photographers.
              <br />
              All in all, we learned that prestudies are very important to figure out the needs of the target group and the special requirements they have.
